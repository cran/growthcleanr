# growthcleanr 2.2.0-prelim-infants - 2023-09-13

## Added

- Added option to cleangrowth for the preliminary infants algorithm -- expands pediatric algorithm to consider 0 - 2 years old, with infants = TRUE in cleangrowth(), with all steps implemented. Note that this option is still preliminary and should not be used for research. For more information regarding the logic of the algorithm, see the vignette 'Preliminary Infants Algorithm.'

# growthcleanr 1.2.4 - 2021-01-14

## Changed

- Minor update to WHO HT velocity 3SD files to correct a small number of errors
  (#24). Affected files were:

  - `inst/extdata/who_ht_maxvel_3sd.csv`
  - `inst/extdata/who_ht_vel_3sd.csv`

  Although these changes were very minor, it is possible that results on data
  cleaned after this change may vary from previous results. The prior version of
  these files may be obtained by visiting the tagged release version 1.2.3 at
  https://github.com/carriedaymont/growthcleanr/releases/tag/1.2.3.

  The released version of `growthcleanr` available at that link contains the
  older version of both files; that older version may be used to verify
  reproducibility.

  Alternatively, a more recent version of `growthcleanr` may be used with only
  the affected files replaced with their older versions available at the 1.2.3
  tag link above. This must be done manually.
