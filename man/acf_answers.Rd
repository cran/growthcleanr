\arguments{
\item{subjid}{Vector of unique identifiers for each subject in the database.}

\item{param}{Vector identifying each measurement, may be 'WEIGHTKG', 'HEIGHTCM', or 'LENGTHCM'
'HEIGHTCM' vs. 'LENGTHCM' only affects z-score calculations between ages 24 to 35 months (730 to 1095 days).
All linear measurements below 731 days of life (age 0-23 months) are interpreted as supine length, and
all linear measurements above 1095 days of life (age 36+ months) are interpreted as standing height.
Note: at the moment, all LENGTHCM will be converted to HEIGHTCM. In the future, the algorithm will be updated to consider this difference.}

\item{agedays}{Numeric vector containing the age in days at each measurement.}

\item{sex}{Vector identifying the gender of the subject, may be 'M', 'm', or 0 for males, vs. 'F',
'f' or 1 for females.}

\item{measurement}{Numeric vector containing the actual measurement data.  Weight must be in
kilograms (kg), and linear measurements (height vs. length) in centimeters (cm).}

\item{orig.exclude}{Vector of exclusion assessment results from cleangrowth()}

\item{sd.recenter}{Data frame or table with median SD-scores per day of life}

\item{ewma.exp}{Exponent to use for weighting measurements in the exponentially weighted moving
average calculations. Defaults to -1.5. This exponent should be negative in order to weight growth
measurements closer to the measurement being evaluated more strongly. Exponents that are further from
zero (e.g. -3) will increase the relative influence of measurements close in time to the measurement
being evaluated compared to using the default exponent.}

\item{ref.data.path}{Path to reference data. If not supplied, the year 2000
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reference data will be used.}

\item{quietly}{Determines if function messages are to be displayed and if log files (parallel only)
are to be generated. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame, containing an index "n" of rows, corresponding to the
original order of the input vectors, and "acf_answers", containing the answers
on whether a height value should be kept or excluded (returns "Definitely
Exclude", "Definitely Include", or "Unknown" for height values, NA for weight
values).
}
\description{
Determines what should absolutely be reincluded or definitely excluded
for a given dataset, already run through \code{cleangrowth}.
